This is our submission to the 2025 Crabhacks hackathon, where we won first place in the education category and first place overall in the competition. The app is meant to serve as a supplement to modern language learning apps like Duolingo, where users can practice verbal fluency with a personalized AI model. After taking an assessment to understand their level of proficiency in the language, the user can chat with our AI model and practice specific situations that they want to learn.
